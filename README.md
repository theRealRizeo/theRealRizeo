### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on projects for [Doltics](https://www.doltics.com)
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning : [GoLang](https://go.dev/) , [Neo4j](https://neo4j.com/) and having fun with [NextJS](https://nextjs.org/) and [Kafka](https://kafka.apache.org/) .
- Lately I have been playing around with Machine Learning on [Doltics Validator](https://github.com/Doltics/doltics-validator) and other cool AI tools :)
